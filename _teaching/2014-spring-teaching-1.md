CRIM 100 provided a broad overview of the study of crime. In this class, students examined the historical foundations of crime and criminology, seminal theories on the etiology of crime, and how criminal justice policies have evolved over time. Students were assigned to read complementary seminal and contemporary papers to provide contextual examples of how people have approached the study of crime. Classes consisted of lectures and informal discussions.
